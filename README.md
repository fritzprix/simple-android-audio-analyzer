## About
> Simple Media Player capable of decomposing audio source into frequency components 

### Note
> THIS PROJECT IS JUST FOR FUN AND VERIFYING MY KNOWLEDGE IN BASIC SIGNAL THEORY AT MOST. SO EFFICIENCY AND PERFORMANCE IS NOT CONSIDERED. 

### Detail
> Convolution of two function in time domain is equivalent to multiplication in frequency domain. meaning convolution between any audio source and the sinusoidal wave with certain frequency acts as frequency slit which extracts given frequency component from the audio source.
